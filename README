Discord Bot for use in guilds

Currently it will take all voice members logged into any channel except a channel
named "AFK". It will output this list in an alphabetically sorted list that can be
used in a spreadsheet.

Grouping System works by Discord Tags, standard tags are 'Defense','Flex 1','Flex 2'.
Any members without these tags will be broken into groups of 5 without priority.

It will also split a group called 'PA' in half to make two groups.
